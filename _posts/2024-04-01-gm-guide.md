Autostede is built from the Lumen engine, which was inspired by Destiny and other looter shooters. The intention in the rules is for the players to be powerful, effective and almost unkillable. In fact the "death" mechanic is actually a super power with an incredibly high cost but unlimited effect. Do your best to bring the spirit of this into the game.
