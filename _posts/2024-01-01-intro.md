# What is this?
Autostede is a tabletop roleplaying game for a GM and 2-5 players that lets you play as the pilot (called a Drover) of a semi-sentient, animalistic mechanical partner (An Autostede).
Drovers are nomads who travel from town to town dealing with problems that the towns have. Most people have Autostedes, but only drovers alter their autostedes to be capable of increased exploration and combat. The world is a dangerous place, and drovers do the hard work to keep it at bay.
# How does it work?
Players in Autostede either play as Drovers or the GM.
Drovers pilot their stedes, taking into consideration its wishes and work together to brave the dangerous wilds and help the townsfolk solve problems.
The GM portrays the world, both the townsfolk that need help and the dangers that threaten the drovers.
Together they weave a story of fearless nomads achieving incredible feats, using the rules of the game to help direct them make the story as dramatic and interesting as possible.
# A Note About Safety
The stories that originally inspired this system, such as Pokemon, Digimon, and Zoids, generally feature children who use their companions as weapons against other companions, not each other. Be aware when you sit down to play this game that the players may expect that to be the case. Alternatively, media properties such as Monster Hunter, Final Fantasy and Dungeons and Dragons often use companions as weapons against other characters.
Talk to the other players about what they expect and want out of this system. There is no wrong answer, though be aware this system does not have mechanics for character damage and death so if that is something that your players are interested in then perhaps you should play a different game, and use The Companion Kit, a free TTRPG toolkit that gives you the ability to import the rules and systems from this game into other games.
