# Attributes
There are three Attributes in Autostede; Power, Handling and Precision. These are not physical characteristics of the character, but instead representations of the ways they prefer to act.

>An action of Power is one where the character or stede is trying to directly overcome an obstacle, such as breaking down a door, hacking through underbrush or tearing an enemy apart.
>An action of Handling is one where the character or stede is relying on speed and reflex to handle a situation, such as slipping through a door as it closes, jumping from tree to tree or taking down an enemy with a thousand small cuts.
>An action of Precision is one where the character or stede is taking their time, acting in the perfect way at the perfect moment, such as picking a lock, carefully negotiating the dry spots in a swamp or lining up that one perfect shot.

# Dice Rolls
When you do something risky, describe what you intend to do and the GM tells you which Attribute that uses. Roll that many dice and choose a single result, add any relevant modifiers and;
>If your result is a 1-3, then you have failed. The GM will tell you what happens.
>If your result is 4-5 then you have succeeded, but at a cost or with a condition.
>If your result is 6 or more then you have succeeded.
These dice rolls are modified further by Skills and Modules.
