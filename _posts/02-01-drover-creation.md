Player characters (Drovers) in Autostede choose to make their life on the road, finding work where they may, often taking food and shelter over money. The wilds are a dangerous place, full of wild stedes, extreme weather patterns. To make their way safely, drovers have hand made and highly personalised air filtration masks that also let them communicate more clearly with their stedes and travel companions. 

# Drover Creation
Drovers are defined in the game by their mask. To make a drover, choose one of the masks as your favourite, and pick one of the looks from it, plus another one of the looks from any mask, to describe what it looks like. You may then increase the rating of 6 skills, 3 from your favourite mask and 3 from the rest. The rating of a skill determines how many dice you roll when you use it. You may increase any one skill to a maximum of 2 during drover creation. Each of the masks is aligned with a particular attribute. When you pick a favourite mask, you can add +1 to its attribute.
